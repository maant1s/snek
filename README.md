little snake project to learn how games work under the hood

features work in progress code for windows, unfinished and doesn't work yet, linux only for now

known bugs:
- the entire windows version
- weird issues with leftover characters in input buffer
- boundary checking might be too unforgiving timing-wise
- only works in default sized window, otherwise the terminal cannot keep up with printing
