little snake project to learn how games work under the hood

features work in progress code for windows, unfinished and doesn't work yet, linux only for now

known bugs:
- the entire windows version
- leftover characters in input buffer resulting in wrong options being selected, sometimes
- boundary checking might be too unforgiving timing-wise
